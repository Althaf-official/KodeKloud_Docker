# practice deploying a registry server on our own.
Run a registry server with name equals to my-registry using registry:2 image with host port set to 5000, and restart policy set to always.

Note: Registry server is exposed on port 5000 in the image.


Here we are hosting our own registry using the open source Docker Registry.

Container Name: my-registry

Host Port: 5000

Image: registry:2

Restart Policy: always

```ruby
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name my-registry registry:2
```
In the `docker run` command you provided, `registry:2` refers to a specific version of the Docker Registry image. Docker Registry is a service that allows you to store and manage Docker images locally within your infrastructure. The `registry:2` image is the second version (v2) of the Docker Registry, and it is one of the most commonly used versions.

Here's why you might want to use `registry:2`:

1. **Stability and Features:** Version 2 of the Docker Registry is more stable and feature-rich compared to the previous versions. It introduced the concept of repositories and made many improvements to the storage and authentication mechanisms, making it the preferred choice for many users.

2. **Compatibility:** It's widely adopted and compatible with a variety of tools and services. Most Docker-related tools and services are built to work seamlessly with Docker Registry version 2.

3. **Security:** It has improved security features and better access control options, which are crucial for managing Docker images securely in a production environment.

4. **Community Support:** Being a popular and widely used version, it has an active community and is well-documented, making it easier to find help and resources.

5. **Bug Fixes:** Version 2 addresses many issues and bugs present in earlier versions, making it a more reliable choice for hosting your Docker images.

The `docker run` command you provided is starting a Docker container using the `registry:2` image, exposing the registry on port 5000, ensuring that the container restarts automatically (even after system reboots), and naming the container "my-registry." This setup allows you to have your own private Docker image registry for your organization or projects, using Docker Registry version 2 for its advantages and features.



# Now its time to push some images to our registry server. Let's push two images for now .i.e. nginx:latest and httpd:latest.


Note: Don't forget to pull them first.

To check the list of images pushed , use curl -X GET localhost:5000/v2/_catalog


Image nginx:latest pushed?

Image httpd:latest pushed?



HINT: Before pushing the images, re-tag them with docker image tag command.



Run: `docker pull nginx:latest` then `docker image tag nginx:latest localhost:5000/nginx:latest` and finally push it using `docker push localhost:5000/nginx:latest`.
We will use the same steps for the second image `docker pull httpd:latest` and then `docker image tag httpd:latest localhost:5000/httpd:latest` and finally push it using `docker push localhost:5000/httpd:latest`



# The `docker image prune -a` command is a Docker command used to remove unused or dangling images from your local Docker environment. It is a way to reclaim disk space by cleaning up images that are no longer associated with any running or stopped containers. Let's break down this command:

1. `docker`: This is the command-line tool used to interact with Docker, the containerization platform.

2. `image`: This subcommand specifies that you want to work with Docker images.

3. `prune`: The `prune` command is used to clean up unused resources, which, in this case, are Docker images.

4. `-a` or `--all`: This flag is used to remove all images, including both dangling (unused) images and images that are associated with running or stopped containers. Without this flag, Docker would only remove dangling images.

Here's a more detailed explanation of what this command does:

- Dangling images: These are images that have no associated containers. They might have been created during a build or pulled from a registry but are no longer in use.

- Images associated with running/stopped containers: The `-a` flag ensures that even images that are currently in use (associated with running containers) or have been used by stopped containers are also considered for removal.

When you run `docker image prune -a`, Docker will prompt you to confirm the removal of these images before actually deleting them. You can confirm the deletion by typing `y` or decline it by typing `n`.

It's important to use this command with caution because it will permanently remove Docker images from your local system. Make sure you understand which images are being deleted to avoid accidentally removing something important. This command is particularly useful for cleaning up your system if you have accumulated a large number of unused images, as it can free up disk space.




# Now we can pull images from our registry-server as well. Use docker pull [server-addr/image-name] to pull the images that we pushed earlier.


In our case we can use: docker pull localhost:5000/nginx

# Let's clean up after ourselves.
Stop and remove the my-registry container.

Use: `docker stop my-registry` and then `docker rm my-registry`
